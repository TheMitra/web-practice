        <h2>13/12 2016 - First blog post</h2>
        <p>So today I am still having a cold. I slept poorly through the night,
         but I am quite satisfied anyways since I actually slept for a couple of 
        hours straight this night. My cold and fever is almost gone aswell. But this
        morning I overslept so I did not eat a proper breakfast or got to shower as I
         planned to do. Today is going to be busy. I have lots of things do do. Firstly
         I am going to school between 8AM to 4PM today. Inbetweeen the breaks today I 
         will be on meetings. After that I am headed to a quick shower before coaching 
        basketball at 5PM. Then I might get a visitor sometime in the evening. 
        Then I am going to cook something simple and then I have done everything
        that needs to be done today. </p>
