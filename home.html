        <h2>What is the purpose of this project?</h2>
        <p>The purpose is that I am going to learn html, css
        and how git works. Maybe even some JavaScript aswell.
        You're welcome to contribute, but it might not be much to 
        contribute to this project other than code improvements
        and such. I'll have some friends to look at my code, and
        you might take a peek aswell. I hope you have a nice day.</p>
